Reactive Programming is trending

    Why are people so excited about reactive programming?
    What does it mean to be reactive? 
    Would it be helpful in our projects? 
    Should we learn how to use it?


-----------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile Java is

    -  is popular with its multi-threading, speed, reliability, and good portability.
    -  but has bad reputation too — 
       it is very hard to write both concurrent
       and simple applications using only the built-in tools
    -  programming requires writing a lot of boilerplate code   

    In other words, 
    Java is powerful and you can create great applications with it,
    but it won't be easy.

    The good news is that there is a way to change that, 
    using the reactive style of programming.

What is reactive programming?

Reactive programming is a paradigm that revolves around the propagation of change. 

In other words, if a program propagates all the changes that modify its data to all the interested parties
(users, other programs, components, and sub-parts), then this program can be called reactive.


A simple example of this is Microsoft Excel. 
If you set a number in cell A1 and another number in cell 'B1',
and set cell 'C1' to SUM(A1, B1); 
whenever 'A1' or 'B1' changes, 'C1' will be updated to be their sum.

Let's call this the reactive sum.

-----------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between assigning a simple variable c 
to be equal to the sum of the a and b variables
and the reactive sum approach?


int a = 4;
int b = 5;
int c = a + b;
System.out.println(c); // 9

a = 6;
System.out.println(c);
// 9 again, but if 'c' was tracking the changes of 'a' and 'b',
// it would've been 6 + 5 = 11


-----------------------------------------------------------

Why should we be reactive?


The easiest way for us to answer this question is to think about the requirements 
we have while building applications these days.


    - today everything should be online 24/7 and 
      should respond with lightning speed; 
    - if it's slow or down,users would prefer an alternative service.
    - Today slow means unusable or broken.
    - We are working with greater volumes of data
      that we need to serve and process fast.


    we have to be fault-tolerant and give our users readable and reasonable message updates.

    In the past, we wrote simple desktop applications,but today we write web applications, 
    which should be fast and responsive. 

-----------------------------------------------------------


    These are the new requirements 
    we have to fulfill if we want our software to be competitive. 
    So in other words we have to be:


    1.Modular/dynamic: 
    -----------------
    This way, we will be able to have 24/7 systems, 
    because modules can go offline and come online without breaking 
    or halting the entire system. 
    Additionally, 
    this helps us better structure our applications 
    as they grow larger and manage their code base.

    2.Scalable: 
    ----------
    This way, we are going to be able to handle
    a huge amount of data
    or large numbers of user requests.

    3.Fault-tolerant:
    -----------------
    This way, the system will appear stable to its users.

    4.Responsive:
    ------------
    This means fast and available.


	-----------------------------------------------------------


    Let's think about how to accomplish this:

	#1
    We can become modular if our system is event-driven.
    We can divide the system into multiple
    micro-services/components/modules
    that are going to communicate with each other using notifications.
    This way, 
    we are going to react to the data flow of the system,
    represented by notifications.

	#2
    To be scalable means 
    to react to the ever-growing data, 
    to react to load without falling apart.

	#3
    Reacting to failures/errors 
    will make the system more fault-tolerant.

	#4
    To be responsive means 
    reacting to user activity in a timely manner.

	
	-----------------------------------------------------------

	#
    If the application is event-driven, 
    it can be decoupled into multiple self-contained components.
    This helps us become more scalable, 
    because we can always add new components 
    or remove old ones without stopping or breaking the system.

	#
    If errors and failures are passed to the right component,
    which can handle them as notifications,
    the application can become more fault-tolerant or resilient. 
    
    #
    So if we build our system to be event-driven, 
    we can more easily achieve scalability and failure tolerance,
    and a scalable, decoupled, and error-proof application 
    is fast and responsive to users.

	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
    Reactive Manifesto (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
    -----------------------------------------------------------


    Changes in the application data can be modeled with notifications,
    which can be propagated to the right handlers. 
    So, writing applications 
    using reactive programming is the easiest way 
    to comply with the Manifesto.
